This Figma design represents a book discovery and reading community interface. The layout includes sections like Featured Books, Recommended Reads, Login/Signup, and Community Clubs.

This design created in Figma :

1. Wireframing each page (Home, Login, Book Details, Community) using frames and grids for proper alignment.

2. Adding UI elements like buttons, input fields, and cards from Figmaâ€™s component library.

3. Using consistent typography and color palette to maintain visual balance.

4. Prototyping interactions such as navigation between pages and hover effects for better user experience.

5. Testing responsiveness by resizing frames for desktop and mobile views.
